# Afedaxo
Afedaxo is the app that helps you to choose a dish if you are not sure about the food you would like to try. It's not just a random picker but it also account the price of dishes so if you're on the budget it increases the chances of cheaper dishes to be picked. Afedaxo also supports multiple people. The process is the following:

1. Take a photo of a menu
2. Select dishes that caught your attention
3. Choose parameters of a recommendation such as how many people are there, does the price matters much or little etc
4. Get a definite recommendation of dishes to try right now using Afedaxo's analytics engine
